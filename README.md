modded-simone
=============

A modified version of the Simone WordPress theme and Underscore theme, after completing the Lynda.com tutorial.

  Underscore: https://github.com/automattic/_s

Note01: This theme has not yet been submitted or checked for the latest standards and practices.

Note02: This is not a child theme of Simone nor of Underscore.  This began as a mod-along project from a Lynda.com tutorial and I decided to continue to work on it.


I modded this theme with the following WordPress plugins installed:

* WP Font Awesome Share Icons: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-font-awesome-share-icons/
* Feedburner Email Subscription: https://wordpress.org/plugins/feedburner-email-subscription/installation/
* Contact Form 7: https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/
